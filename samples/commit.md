To organize the commits and the flow of the project, *__commit rules be followed they are very important__*.

| Branch            | Description                                                  | Sample                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| master            | __Only__ for deployment or preparation for start coding      | master/{what is being done} or x.x.x {version of the application} |
| hotfixes          | Used to fix __urgent bugs or errors__ from master deploy that can't wait for a new release | hotfix/{what is being fixed}                                 |
| releases branches | Final thoughts and minimum implementations to release a new deploy | release/{what is being released}                             |
| develop           | General develop, where the most commits will be done, _in doubts, but it here and add an '?' after dev_. The feature branches will be branching having __this__ branch as base. | dev/{what is being developed} or dev?/{what is being developed} |
| feature branches  | If something need to be fixed or changed, or added (in develop level), basically, new implementations | feature/{what is being created}                              |
